    <h2>The life of J. Robert Oppenheimer</h2>
    <quote>“Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”</quote>
    <ul>
      <li>Born in New York City April 22, 1904.</li>
      <li>Earned a bachelor of arts degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1925.</li>
      <li>A doctorate in physics from the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1927.</li>
      <li>He joined the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a full professor in 1936.</li>
      <li>In 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project.</li>
      <li>In 1943 he was appointed director of the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons.</li>
      <li>On July 16, 1945, he was present at the first test of the atomic bomb.</li>
      <li> In August 1945, the weapons were used against Japan in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</li>
      <li>In 1947, Oppenheimer became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and chaired the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.</li>
      <li>He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb during a 1949–1950 governmental debate.</li>
      <li>During the second Red Scare, Oppenheimer's stances, together with his past associations with the Communist Party USA, led to the revocation of his security clearance, following a 1954 security hearing. This effectively ended his access to the government's atomic secrets and his career as a nuclear physicist. Also stripped of his direct political influence.</li>
      <li>In 1963, as a gesture of political rehabilitation, he was given the Enrico Fermi Award.</li>
      <li>He died four years later February 18, 1967 (aged 62).</li>
      <li>In 2022, the federal government vacated the 1954 revocation of his security clearance.</li>
    </ul>
